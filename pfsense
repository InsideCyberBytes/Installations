Recommended Storage Sizes for pfSense

The storage requirements for pfSense depend on the deployment type and features enabled (such as logging, packages, and caching).
üíæ Minimum Storage Requirements

    Bare Minimum: 4 GB (for basic firewall setup)
    Recommended Minimum: 8 GB (for standard installations)

üìä Recommended Storage by Use Case
Use Case	Recommended Storage	Notes
Basic Firewall (Home/Small Office)	8-16 GB	Ideal for simple routing, DHCP, and NAT with minimal logs.
Business/Enterprise with Logging	32-64 GB	Required for logging, VPNs, Suricata, and additional packages.
High Logging & Packages (Snort, Squid, pfBlockerNG, etc.)	128 GB+	Large log retention, caching, and package-heavy setups.
Enterprise or Multi-WAN with IDS/IPS	256 GB+ (SSD Recommended)	Handles Suricata/Snort logs, VPN tunnels, and complex rules.
üñ•Ô∏è Storage Type Recommendations

    SSD (Recommended): Faster performance, better reliability for logs and caching.
    HDD (If necessary): Acceptable for low-end deployments with minimal logging.
    mSATA/CompactFlash: Suitable for embedded devices with basic firewall functions.

üî• Key Factors Affecting Storage Usage

    Logging & Reporting: Large logs from Suricata/Snort can quickly consume storage.
    VPN & Traffic Caching: Squid Proxy, pfBlockerNG, and VPN logs increase disk usage.
    Package Installations: Extra software like Snort, Suricata, and Zabbix Agent require more space.
